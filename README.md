# get-my-serial-data
* This Python Script simply gets you all the serial data from a tty and delivers it to the terminal screen with a time stamp.
* FYI this script is valid mostly for Linux.
* IMP - You need to get serial Module installed.
* So I am including that module along with these files, So please install that too.

Just do:
python my_serial_test.py
